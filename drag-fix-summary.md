# Drag Functionality Fix - Final Implementation

## Problem Identified
The drag functionality failed because CSS `pointer-events: auto` on `.message-actions` when hovering blocked drag events from reaching the message element.

## Solution Applied

### 1. JavaScript Event Delegation (renderer.js:2986-3012)
- Container-level event listeners on message-list
- Smart filtering to exclude buttons from drag initiation
- Action buttons set to `draggable=false`

### 2. CSS Pointer Events Fix (style.css)
- Changed `.message-item:hover .message-actions` from `pointer-events: auto` to `pointer-events: none`
- Added `.message-actions button` rule with `pointer-events: auto` to keep buttons clickable

## Result
- All messages are now draggable regardless of hover state
- Action buttons remain fully functional when clicked directly
- No interference between drag and button interactions

## Files Modified
- `renderer.js` - Event delegation implementation
- `style.css` - Pointer events correction

The drag functionality should now work correctly for all messages in the queue.
