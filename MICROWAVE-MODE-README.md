# üçΩÔ∏è Microwave Mode - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Microwave Mode is a new feature that works like a microwave beeping when food is ready - it reminds you when a task is completed by repeating the completion sound every minute for 5 minutes, until you interact with the terminal or run another command.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Default Configuration
- **Microwave Mode**: ON by default
- **Sound Effects**: ON by default
- **Completion Sound**: `click.wav` (quick, efficient feedback)
- **Injection Sound**: `click.wav` (consistent rapid feedback)
- **Prompted Sound**: `none` (minimal interruption)

### ‚úÖ Smart Notification System
- **Initial Delay**: 2 seconds after task completion
- **Repeat Interval**: Every 60 seconds (1 minute)
- **Maximum Duration**: 5 minutes (5 beeps total)
- **Auto-Stop Conditions**:
  - User clicks on terminal area
  - Terminal receives focus
  - New command is typed
  - New task/injection starts
  - User manually disables the feature

### ‚úÖ Settings Integration
- Added "Microwave Mode" checkbox in Sound Effects settings
- Integrated with existing sound system
- Persistent preferences (survives app restarts)
- Real-time enable/disable functionality

### ‚úÖ Activity Detection
- **Terminal Focus**: Detects when user focuses on terminal
- **Click Detection**: Monitors clicks on terminal containers
- **Command Detection**: Stops beeping when new commands are typed
- **Task Detection**: Stops beeping when new injections start

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`renderer.js`** - Core logic integration
   - Added microwave mode preferences (default ON)
   - Integrated with timer expiration system
   - Added event listeners for settings
   - Connected to completion/injection sound triggers

2. **`index.html`** - Settings UI
   - Added Microwave Mode checkbox in sound settings
   - Included script references for microwave components

### Files Created
1. **`src/audio/microwave-mode.js`** - Main microwave mode class
   - 5-minute repeat notification cycle
   - Activity tracking and auto-stop logic
   - System notification integration
   - Comprehensive logging

2. **`src/utils/microwave-init.js`** - Initialization helper
   - Handles microwave mode setup with fallbacks
   - Applies default settings to UI
   - Error handling and graceful degradation

## How It Works

### 1. Task Completion Detection
When a task completes (timer expires or terminal becomes idle), the system:
- Checks if microwave mode is enabled
- Verifies user hasn't been recently active
- Starts the 5-minute notification cycle

### 2. Notification Cycle
```
Task Complete ‚Üí Wait 2s ‚Üí First Beep ‚Üí Wait 60s ‚Üí Second Beep ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Fifth Beep ‚Üí Stop
```

### 3. Auto-Stop Logic
The beeping stops immediately when:
- User clicks terminal area
- Terminal receives focus  
- New command is typed
- New injection/task starts
- Maximum 5 beeps reached
- User disables microwave mode

### 4. Sound Integration
- Uses existing `playCompletionSound()` method
- Respects sound effects enabled/disabled setting
- Follows volume and audio preferences
- Integrates with system notifications

## User Experience

### Default Behavior
- Microwave mode is **ON by default**
- Sounds are **enabled by default**
- Uses **click.wav** for quick, non-intrusive feedback
- Prompted sounds are **OFF** to reduce audio clutter

### Customization
Users can:
- Toggle microwave mode on/off in settings
- Change completion sound (affects microwave beeps)
- Disable sound effects entirely
- Adjust other sound preferences

### Visual Feedback
- Settings UI shows current microwave mode state
- Action log records microwave events
- System notifications show beep count (if enabled)
- Console logging for debugging

## Edge Cases Handled

### ‚úÖ Rapid Task Completion
- Only one microwave cycle active at a time
- New tasks stop previous beeping immediately

### ‚úÖ App Restart
- Microwave mode preferences persist
- No beeping for previously completed tasks

### ‚úÖ User Interaction
- Clicking anywhere on terminal stops beeping
- Typing in terminal stops beeping
- Focus changes stop beeping

### ‚úÖ Sound System Issues
- Fallback microwave mode if main class fails to load
- Graceful degradation if sound files missing
- Error handling for audio playback issues

## Testing Performed

### ‚úÖ Basic Functionality
- Microwave mode starts after task completion
- Beeping repeats every minute for 5 minutes
- Stops when user interacts with terminal

### ‚úÖ Settings Integration
- Toggle works in settings UI
- Preferences persist across restarts
- Real-time enable/disable functionality

### ‚úÖ Sound System
- Uses correct sound files (click.wav)
- Respects volume settings
- Works with existing sound preferences

### ‚úÖ Activity Detection
- Terminal clicks stop beeping
- Focus changes stop beeping
- New commands stop beeping

## Performance Impact

### ‚úÖ Minimal Resource Usage
- Uses standard JavaScript intervals
- Cleans up timers properly
- No memory leaks detected

### ‚úÖ Non-Blocking
- Runs asynchronously
- Doesn't interfere with terminal operations
- Lightweight event listeners

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Customizable beep interval (currently 1 minute)
- Customizable maximum duration (currently 5 minutes)
- Different sound effects for microwave beeps
- Visual indicators in addition to audio
- Snooze functionality

### Integration Opportunities
- Integrate with system notifications more deeply
- Add keyboard shortcuts for microwave control
- Sync with external productivity tools
- Custom beep patterns for different task types

## Conclusion

üçΩÔ∏è **Microwave Mode is fully implemented and ready to use!**

The feature provides exactly what was requested:
- Microwave-style beeping when tasks complete
- 5-minute reminder cycle (every minute)
- Smart activity detection to stop beeping
- Default ON with sensible sound choices
- Full settings integration

Users will experience familiar microwave-like behavior - the app "beeps" when their "food" (task) is "ready" (complete), and stops beeping once they "open the door" (interact with the terminal).
