# Auto-Continue Queue Test Analysis

## Implementation Overview

### Key Components Identified:

1. **Auto-Continue State Management** (`renderer.js:4790-4820`)
   - `autoContinueActive`: Boolean flag for overall auto-continue status
   - `autoContinueEnabled`: User preference toggle
   - `continueTargetTerminals`: Set of terminal IDs that need continue messages
   - `autoContinueRetryCount`: Track retry attempts

2. **Usage Limit Integration** (`src/ui/modal-manager.js:573-619`)
   - Usage limit modal with "Enable Waiting Mode" option
   - Automatic queue resumption when limit resets
   - Timer integration for limit reset times

3. **Prompt Detection** (`renderer.js:4792-4816`)
   - Detects Claude prompts and general prompts
   - Adds terminals to `continueTargetTerminals` set
   - Starts persistent auto-continue checking

## Critical Test Scenarios

### 1. Usage Limit Detection Triggers ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Test Pattern**: "Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 3pm"

**Expected Behavior**:
- [ ] Usage limit modal appears immediately
- [ ] Modal offers "Enable Waiting Mode" option  
- [ ] User can choose to queue messages for auto-resume
- [ ] Timer can be set to reset time automatically

**Edge Cases**:
- [ ] Multiple usage limit messages in different terminals
- [ ] Malformed time strings (24hr vs 12hr format)
- [ ] Usage limit during active auto-continue session
- [ ] Usage limit with existing queued messages

### 2. Auto-Continue Queue Priority System ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Implementation Gap**: No explicit priority system found in code

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Queue "continue" messages during usage limit period
- [ ] Verify queued messages are processed in order
- [ ] Test behavior when multiple terminals need continue messages
- [ ] Verify queue persistence across app restarts

**Critical Issue**: Need to verify if "continue" messages get special priority treatment

### 3. Seamless Flow Resumption ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Implementation**: Modal waiting mode should auto-resume injection

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Enable waiting mode during usage limit
- [ ] Wait for limit reset time (or simulate)
- [ ] Verify automatic queue resumption
- [ ] Test recovery if app is closed/reopened during wait
- [ ] Verify no duplicate continue messages sent

### 4. Continue Message Targeting ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Implementation**: `continueTargetTerminals` tracks which terminals need continues

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Verify continue messages go to correct terminal
- [ ] Test multi-terminal scenario with different prompt states
- [ ] Verify terminal removal from set when prompt clears
- [ ] Test edge case: terminal closed while in continue set

### 5. Auto-Continue Edge Cases ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Manual Intervention**:
- [ ] User manually sends message during auto-continue
- [ ] User disables auto-continue mid-process
- [ ] User changes terminal during auto-continue

**Timer Conflicts**:
- [ ] Auto-continue active when timer expires
- [ ] Timer set during auto-continue session
- [ ] Multiple timers with different targets

**Race Conditions**:
- [ ] Multiple prompts detected simultaneously
- [ ] Usage limit + keyword blocking + auto-continue
- [ ] Rapid terminal switching during auto-continue

## Code Analysis Findings

### ‚úÖ Strong Points:
1. **Terminal-Specific Tracking**: Uses `continueTargetTerminals` Set for precise targeting
2. **State Persistence**: Auto-continue state survives across terminals
3. **Retry Logic**: Includes `autoContinueRetryCount` for robustness
4. **Integration**: Well-integrated with usage limit detection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues:
1. **Queue Priority**: No evidence of special priority for "continue" messages
2. **Concurrency**: Possible race conditions with rapid state changes
3. **Memory Leaks**: Terminal IDs may accumulate in Sets if not properly cleaned
4. **Edge Cases**: Complex interaction with keyword blocking + timer expiry

### üîç Missing Features:
1. **Explicit Queue Management**: No dedicated continue message queue found
2. **Priority System**: Continue messages don't appear to jump queue
3. **Persistence**: Auto-continue state may not survive app restart
4. **Timeout Handling**: No apparent timeout for auto-continue attempts

## Recommended Test Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
1. Test auto-continue button toggle
2. Verify prompt detection in single terminal
3. Test continue message sending
4. Verify auto-continue stops when prompt clears

### Phase 2: Usage Limit Integration  
1. Trigger usage limit detection
2. Test "Enable Waiting Mode" functionality
3. Verify queue behavior during limit period
4. Test automatic resumption (simulated)

### Phase 3: Multi-Terminal Scenarios
1. Test multiple terminals with prompts
2. Verify correct terminal targeting
3. Test terminal cleanup on close
4. Test rapid terminal switching

### Phase 4: Edge Cases & Integration
1. Test with keyword blocking active
2. Test with timer expiry
3. Test manual intervention scenarios
4. Test app restart during auto-continue

## Critical Questions for Implementation Team

1. **Queue Priority**: Do "continue" messages actually jump to front of queue?
2. **Persistence**: Is auto-continue state saved to preferences/storage?
3. **Timeout**: Is there a timeout for auto-continue attempts?
4. **Concurrency**: How are race conditions between features handled?
5. **Error Handling**: What happens if continue message fails to send?

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK**:
- Auto-continue could get stuck in infinite loop
- Usage limit + auto-continue interaction could cause confusion
- Memory leaks from uncleaned terminal tracking

**MEDIUM RISK**:
- Continue messages might not reach intended terminal
- State synchronization issues across features
- User experience degradation with multiple active features

**LOW RISK**:
- Minor UI inconsistencies
- Non-critical edge cases in multi-terminal scenarios
