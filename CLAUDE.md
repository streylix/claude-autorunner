# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üö® MANDATORY FOR CLAUDE CODE: ALWAYS TEST & VERIFY üö®

**EVERY SINGLE CHANGE REQUIRES:**
```bash
python test_auto_injector.py start connect wait 15 screenshot "before" [test the change] screenshot "after"
```

**THEN YOU MUST:**
1. **Use unbiased Claude review process** - DO NOT analyze screenshots yourself
2. **Send screenshots to separate Claude process** for objective assessment
3. **Use review command** for automated unbiased analysis
4. **Verify** no UI elements are broken or missing based on Claude review

**SUGGEST NEW CHANGES**
this directory has a file called `addmsg`, run this by doing `./addmsg "<message>" <terminal_number>`. Each message should ONLY contain future prompts to give claude code for improving the system. After every prmopt you complete, I want you to run this command AT LEAST ONCE at the end, writing a propmt for claude code on what to implement later to improve the system, things like:

**QUEUE MANAGEMENT COMMANDS**

This directory also includes powerful queue management commands:

### `./addmsg` - Add Messages to Queue
**Usage:** `./addmsg "message content" [terminal_number]`
**Examples:**
- `./addmsg "ls -la" 1` - Add command to Terminal 1
- `./addmsg "git status" 2` - Add command to Terminal 2
- `./addmsg "echo hello"` - Add to Terminal 1 (default)

### `./listmsg` - List Messages in Queue
**Usage:** `./listmsg [terminal_number] [status] [options]`
**Examples:**
- `./listmsg` - List all messages from all sources
- `./listmsg 1` - List all messages for Terminal 1
- `./listmsg 1 pending` - List pending messages for Terminal 1
- `./listmsg --local` - List only local frontend messages
- `./listmsg --backend` - List only backend API messages
- `./listmsg --count` - Show count summary only

**Options:**
- `--local` - Show only local frontend messages
- `--backend` - Show only backend API messages  
- `--count` - Show count summary only
- `--help` - Show help message

**Data Sources:**
- **Backend API**: Django SQLite database (`/Users/ethan/claude code bot/backend/db.sqlite3`)
- **Frontend Storage**: JSON file (`~/Library/Application Support/auto-injector/auto-injector-data.json`)
- **Dual Storage**: Messages persist in both locations for redundancy

**Message States:**
- `pending` - Queued for execution
- `injected` - Successfully executed
- `cancelled` - Cancelled before execution

**IMPORTANT for Claude Code:** Always use `./listmsg --count` to check queue status before adding new messages. Use `./listmsg 1 pending` to see what's queued for specific terminals.
- Code optimizations
- Improvements to the tester to expand your capabilities
- UX improvements
- Visual improvements
- Feature implementations

ALWAYS INCLUDE REMINDERS NOT TO RUN pkill ON ELECTRON EVER BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THAT PROCESS AND IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING

BE VERY SPECIFIC and reference the codebase to be as precise as possible to ensure your implementation gets properly implemented by future claude code instances, ALSO: if it is something not related to the current context, be sure to add a 'clear' message like:
`./addmsg "/clear" 1` to prevent the agent from being overwhelmed with unnecessary data

Even though YOU SHOULD BE RUNNING `./addmsg "./clear" 1` INBETWEEN EACH MESSAGE, YOU SHOULD STILL ALWAYS FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATIONS MADE AND ENSURING THEY WORK WELL (refining the existing code) BEFORE ADDING NEW FEATURES, think about it like you're a developer, would rather have fully functioning features before making new features as well, but don't be discouraged from making new features

MAKE PERIODIC CHECKS, run: `./addmsg "Look at the last 5 commits and review the changes made and ensure they are up to standard coding practices and function well in the system" 1` TO ENSURE YOU AREN'T MAKING BAD CODE

**VERY VERY IMPORTANT: ONLY WRITE `addmsg` PROMPTS FOR THINGS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT, AS IN, DO RESEARCH ON THE CODEBASE BEFORE SUGGESTING SOMETHING TO BE SURE IT ISNT ALREADY ADDED OR IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY**

To ensure the loop continues and prevent hallucinations always run `./addmsg "/sparc:researcher identify if <claudes_idea> is in the codebase, if not, run addmsg to add the change with detailed instructions on how to do it properly" 1` as the last message to intelligently gain research on the idea and safely check if it already exists and if it is a good idea

**RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM ADDMSG LOOP:**
- Current terminal limit: 4 terminals hardcoded at line 435 in src/terminal/terminal-manager.js
- Renderer.js contains 923 functions making it difficult to maintain - needs modular architecture
- Terminal typing speed is fixed regardless of message length, causing slow injection for long messages
- Sidebars are fixed width and cannot be resized by users
- Message queue only exists in memory and is lost on restart
- Terminal search functionality is basic and lacks advanced features like regex support

**PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED:**
1. Horizontal scrolling for unlimited terminals (maintain 4-visible pattern)
2. Modular architecture refactoring (split renderer.js into specialized managers)
3. Adaptive typing speed based on message length
4. Resizable sidebar functionality 
5. Persistent message queue with crash recovery
6. Advanced terminal search with regex and history

DO NOT JUST USE THESE EXAMPLES, THINK FOR YOURSELF
NEVER NEVER NEVER GO TO MAIN, STAY IN THE 'regenerative-testing' BRANCH

After each prompt, update this file (CLAUDE.md) to improve your ability to add messages to the queue and other areas to be smarter


**IMPORTANT: ALWAYS COMMIT (but do not push) YOUR CHANGES AFTER EACH PROPMPT**
**ü§ñ UNBIASED SCREENSHOT REVIEW PROCESS:**
```bash
# For detailed comparison with difference highlighting
python test_auto_injector.py compare "before" "after" "description of expected change"

# For unbiased Claude review (MANDATORY for all visual verification)
python test_auto_injector.py review "before" "after" "description of expected change"
```

**‚ùå NEVER say "task complete" without:**
- Running the test script with before/after screenshots
- Getting unbiased Claude review of the screenshots
- Confirming the change works based on external review
- Using review command to validate visual changes

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT ANALYZE SCREENSHOTS YOURSELF:**
- Always use the `review` command to send screenshots to separate Claude
- Never rely on your own visual analysis - use external Claude for objectivity
- The review process prevents confirmation bias and ensures accurate assessment

**üí° QUICK IMPROVEMENT TIPS:**
- Add `data-test-id` to any new interactive elements
- Use specific test actions that target your changes
- Wait 2-3 seconds after UI interactions for proper rendering
- Test edge cases (clicking buttons, entering text, modal interactions)

## Commands

### Development Commands
- `npm start` - Start the Electron application in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Start the Electron application in development mode with debugging
- `npm run build` - Build the application for distribution using electron-builder
- `npm run rebuild` - Rebuild native modules for current Electron version
- `npm install` or `npm postinstall` - Install dependencies and rebuild native modules
- `./run.sh` - Interactive script for testing (per Cursor rules)

### Backend Integration (Optional)
- `./start_with_backend.sh` - Start both Django backend and Electron frontend
- `./start_simple.sh` - Start without waiting for backend to be ready
- `cd backend && python manage.py runserver` - Start Django backend separately
- `cd backend && python manage.py migrate` - Run database migrations

### Testing and Validation

**Primary Test Script: `test_auto_injector.py`**
Always use this script for testing changes. It provides automated UI interaction and verification capabilities.

**Critical Testing Requirements:**
1. **Always use `start` command** - Never assume the app is running
2. **Wait for proper loading** - Use `wait 15` after `start` and `wait 2` between commands
3. **Take before/after screenshots** - Visual verification is mandatory
4. **Read and compare screenshots** - Verify changes actually worked
5. **Complete testing cycle** - Only mark tasks complete when functionality is confirmed

**Required Test Script Pattern:**
```bash
python test_auto_injector.py start connect wait 15 screenshot "before_test" [actions] screenshot "after_test" review "before_test" "after_test" "description of change"
```

**Enhanced Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Close specific terminals by ID
close_terminal <terminal-id>

# Detailed screenshot comparison with difference highlighting
compare "before" "after" "terminal close functionality test"

# Unbiased Claude review (MANDATORY for verification)
review "before" "after" "tested terminal close button functionality"

# Console log debugging (AUTOMATIC after connect)
main_logs      # Show main process logs (Node.js/Electron errors)
logs           # Show renderer console logs (browser JavaScript)
all_logs       # Show both main process and renderer logs
```

**Essential Elements for Testing:**

**Data-Test-ID Requirements:**
- Every interactive button MUST have unique `data-test-id` attributes
- Timer inputs: `timer-hours-input`, `timer-minutes-input`, `timer-seconds-input`
- Timer controls: `timer-save-btn`, `timer-cancel-btn`, `timer-play-pause-btn`
- Navigation: `settings-btn`, `add-terminal-btn`, `send-btn`
- Queue controls: `inject-now-btn`, `clear-queue-header-btn`
- Modal controls: All modal close buttons, action buttons

**Key Functional Areas to Test:**
1. **Message Queue System**
   - Add messages to queue
   - Verify queue count updates
   - Test auto-injection timing
   - Verify message execution in terminal

2. **Timer Functionality**
   - Open timer edit (Cmd+B or click timer-edit-btn)
   - Set timer values using proper input data-test-ids
   - Save timer settings
   - Start/pause timer operations
   - Verify countdown and auto-injection

3. **Terminal Operations**
   - Create new terminals
   - Switch between terminals
   - Verify terminal output
   - Test command execution

4. **Settings and Configuration**
   - Open settings modal
   - Modify configuration options
   - Verify settings persistence
   - Test keyboard shortcuts

**Auto-Inject Testing Protocol:**
1. Queue a test command (e.g., `echo 'test' > output.txt`)
2. Set timer to short duration (5-10 seconds)
3. Start timer and wait for injection
4. Verify file creation or terminal output
5. Check action logs for injection events

**Screenshot Verification Requirements:**
- Capture before state showing initial UI
- Document each interaction step
- Capture final state showing changes
- Verify visual indicators (queue counts, timer display, status changes)
- Check for error states or unexpected behavior

**Common Test Scenarios:**
- Basic message queuing and injection
- Timer setting and countdown
- Multi-terminal coordination
- Settings modal interactions
- Voice transcription (if applicable)
- Auto-continue functionality
- Plan mode operations

**Console Log Debugging:**
The test script automatically captures and displays console logs after every `connect` command. This provides visibility into:

**Main Process Logs** (Node.js/Electron):
- Module loading errors (e.g., "Cannot find module './src/messaging/injection-manager'")
- File system operations and errors
- IPC communication between main and renderer processes
- Service worker and database errors
- Application startup and initialization

**Renderer Process Logs** (Browser JavaScript):
- JavaScript console.log, console.error, console.warn output
- Uncaught JavaScript errors and exceptions
- Unhandled promise rejections
- Security warnings (CSP violations)
- Runtime errors in UI components

**Key Debugging Commands:**
```bash
# Logs are automatically shown after connect, but can also be called manually:
python test_auto_injector.py start connect main_logs    # Main process only
python test_auto_injector.py start connect logs         # Renderer only  
python test_auto_injector.py start connect all_logs     # Both processes
```

**Common Error Patterns to Look For:**
- `[SEVERE] node:internal/modules/cjs/loader` - Module loading failures
- `Failed to delete the database: Database IO error` - Storage issues
- `Uncaught Error:` - JavaScript runtime errors
- `Cannot find module` - Missing dependencies
- `Security Warning` - CSP and security configuration issues

**Failure Indicators:**
- Timer shows "Cannot start timer - time not set"
- Messages remain in queue without processing
- UI elements not responding to clicks
- Missing or incorrect visual feedback
- Error messages in action log
- Console errors appearing in main_logs or renderer logs

## üî¥ TESTING ENFORCEMENT RULES üî¥

**FOR CLAUDE CODE SPECIFICALLY:**

1. **BEFORE making ANY code changes** - Take a "before" screenshot to establish baseline
2. **AFTER making ANY code changes** - IMMEDIATELY run the test script
3. **ALWAYS use this exact pattern:**
   ```bash
   python test_auto_injector.py start connect wait 15 screenshot "before_[description]" [relevant test actions] screenshot "after_[description]"
   ```
4. **REQUIRED verification steps:**
   - Read both before/after screenshots visually
   - Confirm expected changes are visible
   - Verify no regressions or broken functionality
   - Check that all UI elements are properly identified with data-test-ids

5. **NEVER COMPLETE A TASK without:**
   - Running the test script successfully
   - Visually confirming the changes work
   - Seeing evidence in screenshots that functionality is working

**Common test patterns to use:**
- **Button changes:** Test clicking the modified button
- **UI changes:** Test the affected interface area  
- **Timer changes:** Test timer setting and auto-injection
- **Queue changes:** Test message queuing and processing
- **Settings changes:** Test opening/modifying settings

**Remember:** This application has complex interactions between UI, timers, queues, and terminal processes. The ONLY reliable way to verify changes is through the visual testing framework.

## Architecture

Auto-Injector is an advanced terminal automation suite built as an Electron desktop application. It enhances the Claude Code terminal experience with message queuing, voice-to-text transcription, smart auto-continue features, and multi-terminal orchestration.

### Core Components
YOU ARE LIKELY BEING RAN WITHIN THIS SCRIPT!!!!! ONLY RUN `npm run` OR `pkill` RARELY
**Main Process (`main.js`)**
- Electron main process handling window management, system tray, and IPC
- Spawns terminal processes using `node-pty` 
- Manages terminal I/O communication between renderer and shell
- Handles file operations, power management, and notifications
- Manages application data persistence and settings

**Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)**
- Contains the `TerminalGUI` class managing the entire application logic
- Uses `@xterm/xterm` for terminal emulation with FitAddon, SearchAddon, and WebLinksAddon
- Implements message queuing system with FIFO processing
- Handles time-based message injection with realistic typing simulation
- Voice recording and transcription integration
- Multi-terminal orchestration and session management
- AI usage limit detection and handling

**UI Structure (`index.html`)**
- Split layout: terminal section (left) and control sidebar (right)
- Multiple terminal containers for concurrent sessions
- Sidebar with queue display, input controls, and timing settings
- Settings modal with extensive configuration options
- Todo list and action log sidebars

### Codebase Function Analysis

**ALWAYS run function analysis before making changes to avoid duplicates:**

```bash
python analyze_functions.py
```

This script analyzes `main.js` and `renderer.js` to extract:
- All function declarations, methods, and arrow functions
- Line counts and locations for each function
- Function purposes based on naming patterns
- Class structure and method organization

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents creation of duplicate functionality
- Helps identify existing functions before writing new ones
- Provides overview of code organization and complexity
- Assists in debugging by locating specific functions

**Function Categories in the Codebase:**
- **Terminal operations**: Functions managing pty processes, terminal UI, and shell communication
- **Message queue system**: Functions handling FIFO queuing, injection scheduling, and typing simulation
- **User interface management**: Functions controlling modals, buttons, dropdowns, and visual feedback
- **Timer and scheduling**: Functions managing countdown timers and auto-injection timing
- **Event handling**: Functions processing user interactions, keyboard shortcuts, and callbacks
- **Data persistence**: Functions saving/loading settings, message history, and application state
- **Voice transcription**: Functions handling audio recording and speech-to-text processing
- **Initialization and setup**: Functions configuring components and establishing connections

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze specific files
python analyze_functions.py main.js renderer.js

# Get full report saved to function_analysis_report.md
python analyze_functions.py
```

**Before coding, check if functionality already exists:**
1. Run `python analyze_functions.py` 
2. Search the output for functions related to your task
3. Examine existing functions before writing new ones
4. Avoid creating duplicate or conflicting functionality

### Security Considerations
- Uses deprecated `nodeIntegration: true` and `contextIsolation: false` settings
- Direct shell access through node-pty requires careful input validation
- Remote module access enabled for window controls

### Ethical Guidelines
- Never kill the system
- Do not kill the process ever

NEVER run pkill -f
      "Electron.*auto-injector"
      && sleep 2) or anything similar
